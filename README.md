### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Lifestyle & Travel
- **Mobile:** This app is primarily mobile because it is to be used on the go while visiting new areas in your vicinity. It will use your location and maps to find local restaurants.
- **Story:** The audience for this app idea is marketed towards undecisive people who are not sure which restaurant to choose.
- **Market:** The user base could potentially be large or small. The audience is for people who can't decide what restaurant to try.
- **Habit:** This app can be used frequently depending on how much the users hit this barrier of not knowing what restaurant to attend.
- **Scope:** This might be a challenge to build this app because you need to first gather the local restaurants through an api possibly. A stripped down version might be possible by entering the restaurants manually. It is a clearly defined product.
